# l5r-tournament-stats

Update the tournament id to match whatever tournament id you want to check. The tournament id is the number on the URL of Lotus Pavillion for the tournament page. (eg. in https://thelotuspavilion.com/tournaments/1461 the id is 1461).
After updating the tournament id, run: 
```
Rscript analysis.R
```

The output will be a csv in the output folder.
